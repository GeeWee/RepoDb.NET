## MinAll

This method is used to get the minimum value of the column from the database.

#### Data Providers

Below are the supported data providers by this operation.

- [SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer)
- [SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqLite)
- [MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.MySql)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.PostgreSql)

#### Installation

To install, simply type the codes below in your Package Manager Console.

```csharp
> Install-Package RepoDb.SqlServer
```

Then call the bootstrapper once.

```csharp
RepoDb.SqlServerBootstrap.Initialize();
```

Or visit our [installation](/tutorials/installation) page for more information.

> In this tutorial, we will use the SQL Server as the database and C# as the programming language.

#### Leanings

Below is a sample code that returns the minimum value of the column *Value* from a *[dbo].[Sales]* table.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
	var expenses = connection.MinAll<Sales>(e => e.Value);
}
```

#### Targetting a Table

You can also target a specific table by passing the literal table and field name like below.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
	var expenses = connection.MinAll("[dbo].[Sales]",
		Field.From("Value"));
}
```

#### Table Hints

To pass a hint, simply write the table-hints and pass it in the `hints` argument.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
	var expenses = connection.MinAll<Sales>(e => e.Value,
		hints: "WITH (NOLOCK)");
}
```

Or, you can use the [SqlServerTableHints](/class/sqlservertablehints) class.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
	var expenses = connection.MinAll<Sales>(e => e.Value,
		hints: SqlServerTableHints.NoLock);
}
```

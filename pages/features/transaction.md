## Transaction

This is a feature that would allow you to work with transaction. The way transaction works in the library is very identical with the way how it works with ADO.NET. It only an abstraction on the functionalities.

> The full implementation of [unit-of-work](/reference/unitofwork) is not being supported in the library. However, this feature is very useful if we are to implement a unit-of-work using this library.

#### Using a Transaction via Connection

Creates a transaction object and pass it when you call any of the operation.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
    {
        // Call the method
        var customerId = connection.Insert<Customer, int>(customer, transaction: transaction);
        var orderId = connection.Insert<Order, int>(order, transaction: transaction);

        // Commit
        transaction.Commit();
    }
}
```

#### Using a Transaction via Repository

Same as previous section, simply create a transaction object and pass it when you call any of the operation.

```csharp
using (var repository = new NorthwindRepository(connectionString))
{
    using (var transaction = repository.CreateConnection().BeginTransaction())
    {
        // Call the method
        var customerId = repository.SaveCustomer<int>(customer, transaction: transaction);
        var orderId = repository.SaveOrder<int>(order, transaction: transaction);

        // Commit
        transaction.Commit();
    }
}
```

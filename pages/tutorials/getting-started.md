## Getting Started

RepoDb is a hybrid-ORM library for .NET. You can use the library to work with [SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer), [SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqLite), [MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.MySql) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.PostgreSql) Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

The project is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/tree/master/RepoDb.SqlServer) and is licensed with [Apache 2.0](http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

This tutorial page is only meant for SQL Server. If you wish to learn the other data providers, please click any of the link below.

- [Getting Started for MySql](/tutorials/getting-started-mysql)
- [Getting Started for PostgreSql](/tutorials/getting-started-postgresql)

#### Installation

The library can be installed via Nuget. In your Package Manager Console, you can type the codes below.

```csharp
> Install-Package RepoDb.SqlServer
```

Once the installation is complete, call the bootstrapper to initialize all the dependencies for [SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer).

```csharp
RepoDb.SqlServerBootstrap.Initialize();
```

If you are to work with Bulk Operations (ie: [BulkDelete](/operation/bulkdelete), [BulkInsert](/operation/bulkinsert), [BulkMerge](/operation/bulkmerge) and [BulkUpdate](/operation/bulkupdate)), then you must install the [RepoDb.SqlServer.BulkOperations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer.BulkOperations) package.

In your Package Manager Console, simply type the codes below.

```csharp
> Install-Package RepoDb.SqlServer.BulkOperations
```

Or visit our [installation](/tutorials/installation) page for more information.

> In this tutorial, we will use the C# as the programming language.

#### Create a Table

```csharp
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Person]
(
	[Id] [bigint] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[Name] [nvarchar](128) NOT NULL,
	[Age] [int] NOT NULL,
	[CreatedDateUtc] [datetime2](5) NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT [CRIX_Person_Id] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([Id] ASC) ON [PRIMARY]
)
ON [PRIMARY];
GO
```

#### Create a Model

```csharp
public class Person
{
	public long Id { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public int Age { get; set; }
	public DateTime CreatedDateUtc { get; set; }
}
```

> The class `model` and database `table` specified above will be used by the samples further on this tutorial.

#### Creating a Record

To create a record, you must use the [Insert](/operation/insert) method.

```csharp
var person = new Person
{
	Name = "John Doe",
	Age = 54,
	CreatedDateUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
};
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var id = connection.Insert(person);
}
```

To insert multiple rows, use the [InsertAll](/operation/insertall) operation instead.

Let us say you had created a method `GetPeople()` that returns the list of `Person`.

```csharp
private IEnumerable<Person> GetPeople(int count = 10)
{
	for (var i = 0; i < count; i++)
	{
		yield return new Person
		{
			Name = $"Person{i}",
			Age = 54,
			CreatedDateUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
		};
	}
}
```

Then simply create a list of `Person` and passed it when you call the [InsertAll](/operation/insertall) method.

```csharp
var people = GetPeople(100);
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var rowsInserted = connection.InsertAll(people);
}
```

> The [Insert](/operation/insert) method returns the `Primary` (or `Identity`) field value while the [InsertAll](/operation/insertall) method returns the number of rows inserted. Both methods will automatically set back the value of the `Identity` property if present.

#### Querying a Record

To query a record, you must use the [Query](/operation/query) method.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var person = connection.Query<Person>(e => e.Id == 1);
	/* Do the stuffs for person here */
}
```

To query all the rows, use the [QueryAll](/operation/queryall) method instead.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var people = connection.QueryAll<Person>();
	/* Do the stuffs for the people here */
}
```

#### Merging a Record

To merge a record, you must use the [Merge](/operation/merge) method.

```csharp
var person = new Person
{
	Id = 1,
	Name = "John Doe",
	Age = 57,
	CreatedDateUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
};
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var id = connection.Merge(person);
}
```

By default, the `Primary` (or `Identity`) field is used as the qualifier. You can also use specify a custom qualifiers.

```csharp
var person = new Person
{
	Name = "John Doe",
	Age = 57,
	CreatedDateUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
};
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var id = connection.Merge(person, qualifiers: Field.From("Name"));
}
```

To merge all the rows, use the [MergeAll](/operation/mergeall) method instead.

```csharp
var people = GetPeople(100);
people
	.AsList()
	.ForEach(p => p.Name = $"{p.Name} (Merged)");
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var affectedRecords = connection.MergeAll<Person>(people);
}
```

> The [Merge](/operation/merge) method returns the `Primary` (or `Identity`) field value while the [MergeAll](/operation/mergeall) method returns the number of rows affected. Both methods will automatically set back the value of the `Identity` property if present.

#### Deleting a Record

To delete a record, you must use the [Delete](/operation/delete) method.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var deletedRows = connection.Delete<Person>(1);
}
```

By default, it uses the primary key as the qualifier. You can also use the other field.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var deletedRows = connection.Delete<Person>(p => p.Name == "John Doe");
}
```

To delete all the rows, use the [DeleteAll](/operation/deleteall) method instead.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var deletedRows = connection.DeleteAll<Person>();
}
```

You can also pass the list of primary keys to be deleted.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var primaryKeys = new [] { 10045, 11001, ..., 12011 };
	var deletedRows = connection.DeleteAll<Person>(primaryKeys);
}
```

> Both the [Delete](/operation/delete) and [DeleteAll](/operation/deleteall) methods return the number of rows affected during the execution.

#### Updating a Record

To update a record, you must use the [Update](/operation/update) method.

```csharp
var person = new Person
{
	Id = 1,
	Name = "James Doe",
	Age = 55,
	DateInsertedUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
};
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var affectedRecords = connection.UpdateAll<Person>(people);
	var updatedRows = connection.Update<Person>(person);
}
```

You can also update via dynamic by targetting certain columns.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var affectedRecords = connection.UpdateAll<Person>(people);
	var updatedRows = connection.Update("Person", new { Id = 1, Name = "James Doe" });
}
```

To update all the rows, use the [UpdateAll](/operation/updateall) method instead.

```csharp
var people = GetPeople(100);
people
	.AsList()
	.ForEach(p => p.Name = $"{p.Name} (Updated)");
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var updatedRows = connection.UpdateAll<Person>(people);
}
```

By default, the `Primary` (or `Identity`) field is used as a qualifier. You can also specify your custom qualifiers.

```csharp
var people = GetPeople(100);
people
	.AsList()
	.ForEach(p => p.Name = $"{p.Name} (Updated)");
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var updatedRows = connection.UpdateAll<Person>(people, qualifiers: Field.From("Name"));
}
```

> Both the [Update](/operation/update) and [UpdateAll](/operation/updateall) methods return the number of rows affected during the execution.

#### Executing a Query

To execute a query use the [ExecuteNonQuery](/operation/executenonquery) method.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var affectedRecords = connection.ExecuteNonQuery("DELETE FROM [dbo].[Person] WHERE Id = @Id;", new { Id = 1 });
}
```

To execute a query while expecting a result of class object, then use the [ExecuteQuery](/operation/executequery) method.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var people = connection.ExecuteQuery<Person>("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Person] ORDER BY Id ASC;");
	/* Do the stuffs for the people here */
}
```

To execute a query while expecting a single result, then use the [ExecuteScalar](/operation/executescalar) method.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var maxId = connection.ExecuteQuery<Person>("SELECT MAX(Id) FROM [dbo].[Person];");
}
```

To execute a query while expecting a result of `DbDataReader`, then use the [ExecuteReader](/operation/executereader) method.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	using (var reader = connection.ExecuteReader("SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Person];"))
	{
		/* Do the stuffs for the data reader here */
	}
}
```

#### Executing a Stored Procedure

To execute a stored procedure, then you can use any of the `Execute` methods mentioned above, but you have to passed the `CommandType` as `CommandType.StoredProcedure`.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var people = connection.ExecuteQuery<Person>("[dbo].[sp_GetPeople]", commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);
}
```

> Beware of not putting a semi-colon at the end of the calls.

Or, you can direct call using the `EXEC` command. No need to pass the the value of `CommandType.StoredProcedure`.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var people = connection.ExecuteQuery<Person>("EXEC [dbo].[sp_GetPeople];");
}
```

This is the official site of [RepoDb](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb) library. The intention of this site is to provide and guide you as a developer with all the information needed when using the RepoDb library.

[RepoDb](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb) is an open-source .NET ORM that bridge the gaps between micro-ORMs and full-ORMs. It helps the developer to simplify the switch-over of when to use the BASIC and ADVANCE operations during the development.

You can use the library to work with [SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer), [SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqLite), [MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.MySql) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.PostgreSql) Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

It is here to improve the things and experiences when working with the Data Access Technology in .NET space.
